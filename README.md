# bot for sheriff crazy
This bot is written for an old friend of mine, who actively streams on twitch.  
It counts messages and gives users a role after n-messages sent on the server that allows users to share pictures.  

All sent messages will be counted for each user so that we could implement a custom level system one day (message content isn't saved!).  

## setup
I won't show you how to set this project up, since it contains hardcoded variables...  
There are only two reasons why this is public:  
1. To show his server members what the bot does and that it doesn't log message contents etc.  
2. So that I'm able to deploy it better without bothering about access to my private repos.
